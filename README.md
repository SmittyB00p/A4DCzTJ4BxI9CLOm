## Customer Satisfaction

This project looks to predict the satisfaction of customers of a food delivery service from customers' survey responses.

Using classification techniques, ensemble techniques, and dimensionality reduction, this project looked to find the optimal model to classify both satisfied and unsatisfied customers as well as find the optimal number of features to use where the model would not loose out on the performance metric (recall).
The features selection also helps the company to decide which questions to keep and which questions to throw out of their survey.
